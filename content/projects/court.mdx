# Court of Military Justice of Rio Grande do Sul
## How I started my career in the IT field

I started my career in the IT field in 2024, when I was hired as an intern at the Court of Military Justice of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. I've been working there for 6 months, and I've learned a lot during this time.

My first official task when I started was to create a graph that showed the number of times each connection to our servers failed to establish. This graph was very important because it helped us to identify the main problems that were causing the failures.
