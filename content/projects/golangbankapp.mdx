### Accounts Table

- id bigserial [pk]

| Name | Storage Size | Description | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bigserial | 8 bytes (64 bits) | large autoincrement int | 1 to 9223372036854775807 |
- **`bigserial`** should be used if you anticipate the use of more than $2^{31}$ identifiers over the lifetime of the table.
- owner varchar
  - The name of the owner of the account
- balance bigint
  - It is used to facilitate the process, but in real life, some currencies use decimal types
- currency varchar
  - Label for the currency type (e.g. Dollar, Euro, Real, etc)
- created_at timestamptz
  - timestamptz stands for “timestamp with time zone”.
  - **Stores Date and Time**: It records both the date and the time.
  - **Includes Time Zone Information**: It is timezone-aware, meaning it stores the timestamp in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) and displays it in the session’s time zone.
  - **Automatic Time Zone Adjustment**: When you insert a timestamp with a time zone into a `timestamptz` column, PostgreSQL converts it to UTC for storage. When you retrieve the value, it is converted back to the session’s time zone.

### Benefits of Using ‘timestamptz’

  1. **Time Zone Awareness:**
 - Ensures that timestamps are consistent globally. Regardless of where the data is inserted or queried from, the ‘**timestamptz’** type helps maintain a consistent and accurate time record.
  2. **Avoids Ambiguities:**
 - Handles daylight saving time changes and other time zone-related issues, avoiding the common pitfalls of time zone differences.
  3. **Convenience:**
 - Automatically converts timestamps to the appropriate time zone when displaying to users, which can simplify handling date and time data in applications.

### Important Notes

  - **Session Time Zone:**
  - The displayed time zone can be affected by the session’s time zone setting. You can set the session’s time zone using -e TZ=Timezone:

  ```bash
  docker run --name postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=root \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret \
    -e TZ=America/Sao_Paulo \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    -d postgres:16.3-alpine3.19
  ```

  - **Comparison and Arithmetic:**
  - ‘timestamptz’ allows direct comparison and arithmetic operations on timestamps, which can be very useful for queries involving time ranges, differences, etc.
