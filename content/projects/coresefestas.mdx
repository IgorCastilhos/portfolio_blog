### Design

I created the design in Figma, and the development was done using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Why there's not a shopping cart?

The store is focused on selling products to birthday parties, so the user can see the products and go to the physical store to buy them.

### How many developers worked on this project?

I worked alone on this project.

### Can I see the code?

No, the code is not publicly available.
