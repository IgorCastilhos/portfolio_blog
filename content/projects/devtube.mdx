# Devtube: Learning Platform using Next.js

Devtube is a project that I created to help students who can't afford to go to university. It is a platform where students can learn the most used technologies used in the market.

### Technologies used

I used Next.js to create the platform, Stripe as the payment gateway and many more libraries.

### Professor Mode
